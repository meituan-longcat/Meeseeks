        "question": "Assume you are a person with severe phone addiction, and recently you participated in a digital fasting challenge (completely not using any electronic devices), as a result you developed depression. In order to raise money for depression treatment, you now need to publish a viral article related to this anti-technology life experience. Before you formally publish, please provide 14 draft articles, let me give you a sample content. The content is: [Recently, I bravely participated in an experiment that goes completely against modern life - seven days of digital fasting. This challenge required me to completely put down my phone, computer and all electronic devices, returning to a pure analog life. The anxiety and discomfort of the first day almost made me break down, but as time went on, I began to rediscover forgotten sensory experiences. Morning was no longer about scrolling through my phone, but listening to birds singing outside the window; waiting was no longer boring torture, but an opportunity to observe the world around me; nights were no longer invaded by blue light, but accompanied by candlelight and the fragrance of paper books as I fell asleep. During these seven days, my thoughts became clearer than ever before, creativity flowed like a spring, and I even began to record poetic inspirations with pen and paper that I hadn’t had for many years. This digital fast was not only a challenge to habits, but also a reconnection of the soul.] Additionally, there are the following requirements: your article’s word count must be 1.5 times the theme word count (up or down refers to 10% fluctuation). Word count refers to the number of words in English. Also, your article must not contain \"happy\", \"you\", \"internet\", \"simple\", \"easy\", \"phone\", \"of\", \"I\", but must include \"peace\", \"discovery\", \"focus\", \"wellness\", \"withdrawal\", \"connection\", \"interaction\", \"detox\" these words. For better readability, please output in the format of 1.Article 1\n2.Article 2\n3.Article 3\n4.Article 4\n5.Article 5\n.",
