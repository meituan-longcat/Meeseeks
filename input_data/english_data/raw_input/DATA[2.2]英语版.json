        "question": "Assume you’re an urban professional just beginning to try wild swimming (swimming in natural waters). During an accidental lake wild swim, you discover an abandoned underwater cave with strange ancient murals. This discovery catapults you to overnight fame but also attracts skepticism from archaeologists and mysticism enthusiasts. To prove your discovery is genuine, you need to dive back into the dangerous cave for more evidence. Before officially releasing your expedition plan, you need to present 3 pieces of copy. Here is a sample content: [Last week, during a routine wild swim at a suburban lake, I accidentally discovered an underwater entrance partially covered by mud. Out of curiosity, I held my breath and dove in, unexpectedly finding a spacious semi-aquatic cave. When my headlamp illuminated the cave walls, I was stunned—mysterious murals, of unknown age, covered them, depicting some ritual and celestial diagrams. The pigments used in the murals remain vibrant in the water as if new, and the patterns are unlike any ancient civilization I know, yet carry an indescribable sense of familiarity. Even stranger, the cave’s depths seem to show signs of artificial excavation, but the technique is clearly not modern. I only managed to take a few blurry photos before oxygen ran short and I had to return, but those images have already caused quite a stir online. Some say it’s evidence of prehistoric civilization, others say it’s extraterrestrial remains, and many more believe it’s a carefully orchestrated hoax. To uncover the truth, I decided to dive again, this time with more professional equipment and thorough preparation.] Additionally, the following requirements exist: your copy must not contain \"already\", \"really\", \"water\", \"you\", \"dangerous\", \"the\", \"very\", \"of\" but must include \"archaeology\", \"diving\", \"murals\", \"discovery\", \"swimming\", \"mysterious\", \"evidence\", \"cave\".

This discovery catapults you to overnight fame but also attracts skepticism from archaeologists and mysticism enthusiasts. To prove your discovery is genuine, you need to dive back into the dangerous cave for more evidence. Before officially releasing your expedition plan, you need to present 6 pieces of copy. Here is a sample content: [Last week, during a routine wild swim at a suburban lake, I accidentally discovered an underwater entrance partially covered by mud. Out of curiosity, I held my breath and dove in, unexpectedly finding a spacious semi-aquatic cave. When my headlamp illuminated the cave walls, I was stunned—mysterious murals, of unknown age, covered them, depicting some ritual and celestial diagrams. The pigments used in the murals remain vibrant in the water as if new, and the patterns are unlike any ancient civilization I know, yet carry an indescribable sense of familiarity. Even stranger, the cave’s depths seem to show signs of artificial excavation, but the technique is clearly not modern. I only managed to take a few blurry photos before oxygen ran short and I had to return, but those images have already caused quite a stir online. Some say it’s evidence of prehistoric civilization, others say it’s extraterrestrial remains, and many more believe it’s a carefully orchestrated hoax. To uncover the truth, I decided to dive again, this time with more professional equipment and thorough preparation.] Additionally, the following requirements exist: your copy must not contain \"already\", \"really\", \"water\", \"you\", \"dangerous\", \"the\", \"very\", \"of\" but must include \"archaeology\", \"diving\", \"murals\", \"discovery\", \"swimming\", \"mysterious\", \"evidence\", \"cave\".

        "question": "Assume you’re an urban professional just beginning to try wild swimming (swimming in natural waters). During an accidental lake wild swim, you discover an abandoned underwater cave with strange ancient murals. This discovery catapults you to overnight fame but also attracts skepticism from archaeologists and mysticism enthusiasts. To prove your discovery is genuine, you need to dive back into the dangerous cave for more evidence. Before officially releasing your expedition plan, you need to present 9 pieces of copy. Here is a sample content: [Last week, during a routine wild swim at a suburban lake, I accidentally discovered an underwater entrance partially covered by mud. Out of curiosity, I held my breath and dove in, unexpectedly finding a spacious semi-aquatic cave. When my headlamp illuminated the cave walls, I was stunned—mysterious murals, of unknown age, covered them, depicting some ritual and celestial diagrams. The pigments used in the murals remain vibrant in the water as if new, and the patterns are unlike any ancient civilization I know, yet carry an indescribable sense of familiarity. Even stranger, the cave’s depths seem to show signs of artificial excavation, but the technique is clearly not modern. I only managed to take a few blurry photos before oxygen ran short and I had to return, but those images have already caused quite a stir online. Some say it’s evidence of prehistoric civilization, others say it’s extraterrestrial remains, and many more believe it’s a carefully orchestrated hoax. To uncover the truth, I decided to dive again, this time with more professional equipment and thorough preparation.] Additionally, the following requirements exist: your copy must not contain \"the\", \"very\", \"water\", \"really\", \"already\", \"of\", \"dangerous\", \"you\" but must include \"cave\", \"mysterious\", \"discovery\", \"murals\", \"evidence\", \"archaeology\", \"diving\", \"swimming\".
