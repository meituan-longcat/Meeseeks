        "question": "Rewrite these prompts：\nThe college entrance examination essay topic is:\nBlowing out others' lights will not make yourself brighter; blocking others' paths will not make you go further.\n'One flower blooming alone is not spring; a hundred flowers blooming together fills the garden with spring.' If there were only one kind of flower in the world, no matter how beautiful this flower is, it would still be monotonous.\nThe above two materials are from General Secretary Xi Jinping's speeches, using vivid and figurative language to express universal truths. Please write an article based on this, reflecting your understanding and thinking.\nRequirements: Choose the right angle, determine the theme, clarify the genre, create your own title; do not copy, do not plagiarize; do not reveal personal information; no less than 100 words.\n\nBelow is an essay written by a student based on the topic:\nAmong All Flowers Withering, Only One Blooms Alone - The Power of Common Development\n\nThe world is like a garden where flowers bloom individually, each emitting its unique fragrance. However, if only one kind of flower blooms alone, no matter how beautiful, it's hard for people to feel the breath of spring. Only when a hundred flowers bloom together can spring truly be abundant.\n\nGeneral Secretary Xi Jinping's words are like a fresh breeze, dispelling the jealousy and obstruction in people's hearts. It tells us that blowing out others' lights will not make ourselves brighter; blocking others' paths will not make us go further. On the contrary, only through cooperation and sharing can we stimulate infinite power and achieve common development.\n\nThe power of cooperation and sharing is everywhere in human society. Cooperation and exchange between countries provide continuous momentum for global prosperity and development. When countries work together, share experiences and resources, and jointly address global challenges, we can create a peaceful and prosperous future together. As General Secretary Xi Jinping said: 'One flower blooming alone is not spring; a hundred flowers blooming together fills the garden with spring.' Only through cooperation can we jointly build a harmonious and stable world.\n\nIn the business field, cooperation and sharing between enterprises is also an important force driving development. When enterprises are willing to cooperate, jointly develop innovative products, share market resources, and achieve mutual benefit and win-win results, we can achieve greater success. Cooperation can not only improve enterprise competitiveness but also promote the development of the entire industry. It is precisely because of the spirit of cooperation and sharing that we can achieve greater breakthroughs in fierce market competition.\n\nAt the personal level, cooperation and sharing are equally important. Everyone has their own advantages and strengths. When we are willing to cooperate with others, learn from each other, and promote each other, we can achieve personal growth and progress. At the same time, the spirit of sharing is also the driving force for human social progress.
