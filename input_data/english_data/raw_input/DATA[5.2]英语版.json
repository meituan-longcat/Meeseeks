Your participation is of great significance to us, so we also hope to ensure that you can fully utilize your abilities and provide the highest quality and most valuable responses through sufficient information transmission.\nFirst, it needs to be emphasized that this task involves a relatively broad range of domain knowledge, potentially covering multiple disciplines and spanning different application scenarios. We hope you can approach the problems with an open and inclusive mindset, combining your rich knowledge system to think and analyze from multiple angles and levels. Even when encountering areas you are not familiar with, we hope you can provide reasonable and innovative insights based on existing information and logical reasoning.\nSecond, the content of this task may have certain complexity and ambiguity, with some questions possibly having no standard answers or requiring you to make reasonable inferences and assumptions under incomplete information. In such cases, we value your thinking process and analytical methods more than just the final conclusions. Therefore, when answering, please elaborate on your thought process in detail, including the facts you rely on, the assumptions you make, the reasoning paths you adopt, and the final conclusions you reach. This not only helps us understand your answers but also enhances the transparency and interpretability of the entire communication.\nAdditionally, since this task may involve multiple rounds of dialogue or multiple supplements and corrections of information, please pay attention to the consistency and coherence of your content when answering. If you find contradictions or inconsistencies in the information, you can proactively point them out and offer your understanding and suggestions. We encourage you to present your independent insights and judgments while maintaining objectivity and neutrality.\nFurthermore, to ensure your responses better meet our actual needs, we will provide some supplementary materials, examples, or relevant definitions in the follow-up. Please conduct comprehensive analysis combining the context after receiving this information. If there are any unclear points, you can also proactively raise your questions, and we will provide timely supplementary explanations and clarifications.\nIn terms of language expression, we hope you can maintain conciseness and clarity while paying attention to logic and organization. For some technical terms or complex concepts, please provide appropriate explanations to ensure readers from different backgrounds can understand your meaning. If necessary, you can appropriately use analogies, examples, and other methods to assist in explanation.\nIt's worth mentioning that the output content of this task will be used for subsequent data organization, knowledge accumulation, model optimization, and other multiple processes, so each of your responses is very important. We will conduct comprehensive evaluation of your output, including correctness, completeness, innovation, readability, and other aspects. We hope you can treat each response with a high sense of responsibility and professionalism.\nFinally, thank you again for your patience and cooperation.
