Also remember to specify time, location, scene, etc. Required to be around 77 words.\n2. Plot Card Introduction:\nThe plot card introduction is shown to users.

Also remember to specify time, location, scene, etc. Required to be around 66 words.\n2. Plot Card Introduction:\nThe plot card introduction is shown to users. It can briefly introduce the beginning part of the plot, but cannot completely spoil it (preserve user interest and suspense). It's best to have a somewhat suspenseful ending to attract user participation interest, similar to a plot synopsis. Required to be around 99 words.
