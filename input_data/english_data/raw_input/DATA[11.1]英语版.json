Her son had gone to work in the city and rarely returned. One day, she received a letter informing her that her son had died in an accident. The letter slipped from her hands as tears streamed down her face. From that day on, she sat daily in the courtyard where her son had played as a child, quietly recalling their once joyous laughter. As autumn leaves fell gently in the courtyard, they seemed to mourn with her. \n Please give me in total 15 sentences，every sentence shall include 9 English words. At least 50% of the sentences of the poem must rhyme.",
